This website helps users manage their job search by tracking the status of all their applications in one place. It's a perfect fit for a CRUD-based backend and has clear opportunities for extensions.

Core CRUD Functionality:
Create: A user can add a new job application entry, including details like company name, job title, date applied, and a link to the job posting.

Read: The user can view a list of all their job applications. Each entry would show key details, and a dedicated page for each application would display more detailed information.

Update: The user can edit an existing application to update its status (e.g., "Applied," "Interview Scheduled," "Offer Received," "Rejected").

Delete: The user can remove a job application from their list.
